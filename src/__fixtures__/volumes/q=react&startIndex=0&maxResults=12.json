React.js shrugs away common front-end conventions in an effort to make things more efficient - use Introduction to React to learn about this framework and more today. Get to know the React API and it’s specific JavaScript extension, JSX, which makes authoring React components easier and maintainable. You will also learn how to test your React applications and about the tools you can use while building. Once you understand these core concepts, you can build applications with React. This will help you cement the ideas and fundamentals of React and prepare you to utilize React in your own use case. What You'll Learn: How to use React to maintain complex user interfaces in an efficient way How to integrate existing user interfaces and move forward with React How to manage application architecture using Flux How to easily utilize JSX, React's JavaScript extension",

        "description": "Let us full stack development with Spring Boot and React JS. DESCRIPTION Designing Application with Spring Boot 2 & React JS is divided into three parts. The first part introduces you to the essentials of the Spring Boot 2.2 Framework and you will learn how to create REST APIs and how to secure REST APIs. Part 2 steps behind the front end application development with React JS and discuss React features and its advantages toward the front end application development. Part 3 expands on that by showing how to deploy backend and frontend application the PaaS platform and also will discuss how to deploy application container technologies such as Docker. KEY FEATURES ● This book has a very specific goal to make developing REST applications easier and focusing on common challenges of the design of the application with best practices. ● This book is providing practical code examples from real-world experiences. ● This book is not only about Spring Boot 2.2 and React JS overview but also has an in-depth discussion about adopted REST Architectural pattern and its constraints to create the REST APIs. ● The book can act as a tool for learning Spring Boot 2.2 and React JS for the first time as well as a guide and reference for those wanting to dig deeper into specific features. ● This book is also providing deeper information about the Spring Security and JWT token-based authentication for your REST applications. ● This does not only provide information about to design an application using Spring Boot and React JS but also providing how to deploy your application to the cloud platform (PaaS). ● Containerization using Docker is another key feature of this book, how to create a Docker image and how to run it. WHAT WILL YOU LEARN ● Exploring Spring Boot 2.2 new features and essential key components such as Starters, Autoconfiguration, CLI, Actuator. ● Develop a REST application using Spring Boot 2.2 and DevTools. ● Exploring Spring Boot Auto Configuration and Customization. ● Creating application profiles based on the environments. ● Learn to configure backend data using JDBC and Spring Data JPA. ● Learn to configure a DataSource for H2 DB, and also for Maria DB. ● Learn best practices for designing a REST architecture based application. ● Creating a REST application using HATEOAS. ● Consuming REST APIs endpoints with RestTemplate, Traverson, and WebClient. ● Exploring JWT web token for the RESTful APIs and explores how to secure REST APIs using OAuth2 and Spring security. ● Creating TESTING module of the Spring Boot application and Unit & Integration testing. ● Discuss React JS and its components and also discuss React KS features and its advantages and disadvantage. ● Exploring how to create ReactJS components and how to manage ReactJS component lifecycle. ● Taking a quick overview of consuming the REST API using the React application. ● Deploying the application to the Cloud platform (PaaS). ● Containerization and Deploy using Docker containers WHO THIS BOOK IS FOR Designing Application with Spring Boot 2.2 & React JS is for all Java developers who want to learn Spring Boot 2.2 and React JS as in the enterprise application. Therefore, enterprise Java developers will find it particularly useful in the understanding of Spring Boot 2.2 and React JS and how to develop a backend RESTful application using the Spring Boot 2.2 and frontend application using React JS framework. They will most fully appreciate the examples presented in this book. Before reading this book, readers should have basic knowledge of core java, spring, servlet, filter, XML, and JavaScript. TABLE OF CONTENTS Getting Started with Spring Boot 2.2 Customizing Auto-Configuration Configuring Data and CRUD operations Creating REST APIs with Spring Boot 2.2 Securing REST APIs Testing Spring Boot Application Getting Started with React Creating and Styling React Components Consuming the REST API with React JS Deploying and Containerizing Application",

Learn by doing through an example-driven approach, and have a substantial running app at the end of each chapter. This second edition is fully updated to include ES7 (ECMAScript 7), the latest version of React Native (including Redux), and development on Android. You will start by setting up React Native and exploring the anatomy of React Native apps. You'll then move on to Redux data flow, how it differs from flux, and how you can include it in your React Native project to solve state management differently and efficiently. You will also learn how to boost your development by including popular packages developed by the React Native community that will help you write less; do more. Finally, you'll learn to how write test cases using Jest and submit your application to the App Store. React Native challenges the status quo of native iOS and Android development with revolutionary components, asynchronous execution, unique methods for touch handling, and much more. This book reveals the the path-breaking concepts of React.js and acquaints you with the React way of thinking so you can learn to create stunning user interfaces. What You'll Learn Build stunning iOS and Android applications Understand the Redux design pattern and use it in your project Interact with iOS and android device capabilities such as addressbook, camera, GPS and more with your apps Test and launch your application to the App Store Who This Book Is For Anyone with JavaScript experience who wants to build native mobile applications but dreads the thought of programming in Objective-C or Java.

But, unfortunately, most sales persons are not good at gaining new business, much less performing even the most basic prospecting practices. There are a multitude of reasons for this phenomenon. But the biggest reason is that sales professionals are untrained in vital cold-calling techniques. Especially in the realm of cold-calling and prospecting. Further, there is a culture of sales resistance that exists, and few sales professionals are equipped to penetrate it.

But even if you are confronted by the unthinkable, you don't have to become a victim. This important new book shows you how you can protect yourself regardless of your age, sex or level of fitness by using the simple but effective REACT formula: R: Recognise E: Evaluate A: Alternatives C: Concentrate T: Terminate Using clear and concise step-by-step instructions, reinforced with many illustrations and diagrams, each of these five basic principles is expanded and explained in such a way that they quickly become 'second nature'. Following this sequence in any circumstance will allow you to recognise potential threats, decide on the best form of action to take and equip you carry to this through. While The R.E.A.C.T. Self defence System does concentrate on a dozen or so straightforward but effective self-protection combat techniques, it is not just another self-defence book, full of impractical or ineffective martial arts routines.
