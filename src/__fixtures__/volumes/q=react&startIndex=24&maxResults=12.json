        "description": "Create large-scale web applications with code that is extensible and easy to understand using React Hooks Key Features Explore effective strategies for migrating your state management from Redux and MobX to React Hooks Integrate Hooks with React features such as Context and Suspense to add advanced functionality to your web apps Create complex applications by combining multiple hooks Book Description React Hooks revolutionize how you manage state and effects in your web applications. They enable you to build simple and concise React.js applications, along with helping you avoid using wrapper components in your applications, making it easy to refactor code. This React book starts by introducing you to React Hooks. You will then get to grips with building a complex UI in React while keeping the code simple and extensible. Next, you will quickly move on to building your first applications with React Hooks. In the next few chapters, the book delves into various Hooks, including the State and Effect Hooks. After covering State Hooks and understanding how to use them, you will focus on the capabilities of Effect Hooks for adding advanced functionality to React apps. You will later explore the Suspense and Context APIs and how they can be used with Hooks. Toward the concluding chapters, you will learn how to integrate Redux and MobX with React Hooks. Finally, the book will help you develop the skill of migrating your existing React class components, and Redux and MobX web applications to Hooks. By the end of this book, you will be well-versed in building your own custom Hooks and effectively refactoring your React applications. What you will learn Understand the fundamentals of React Hooks and how they modernize state management in React apps Build your own custom Hooks and learn how to test them Use community Hooks for implementing responsive design and more Learn the limitations of Hooks and what you should and shouldn’t use them for Get to grips with implementing React context using Hooks Refactor your React-based web application, replacing existing React class components with Hooks Use state management solutions such as Redux and MobX with React Hooks Who this book is for This book is for React developers who want to learn how to build applications with Hooks. Developers who are looking to migrate to React for its advanced feature set and capabilities will also find the book useful.",

        "description": "Discover how to use React Native in the real world, from scratch. This book shows you what React Native has to offer, where it came from, and where it’s going. You'll begin with a solid foundation of practical knowledge, and then build on it immediately by constructing three different apps. You'll learn how to use each feature of React Native by working on two full projects and one full game. These aren’t just simple React Native Hello World examples (although you’ll naturally start there!) but are apps that you can, if you so choose, install on your mobile devices and use for real. Throughout this book, you'll gain real-world familiarity with React Native as well as supporting components from Expo, NativeBase, React Navigation and the Redux and Lodash libraries. You'll also build server-side code for a mobile React Native app to talk to using the popular Node.js and Socket.io library, providing you a holistic view of things even beyond React Native. And, you'll see many helpful tips, tricks and gotchas to watch out for along the way! Practical React Native offers practical exercises that will give you a solid grasp of building apps with React Native, allowing you to springboard into creating more advanced apps on your own.Creating a game with React Native will allow you to see a whole other perspective on what React Native can do. What You'll Learn Master the basics of React Native Create a logically structured project Review interface elements, such as widgets, controls, and extensions Build layouts Work with Expo, an open source toolchain Who This book Is For The primary audience is mobile developers and anyone looking to build for multiple mobile platforms and trying to do so with a codebase that is largely the same across all. Readers will need a decent foundation, but not necessarily be experts in, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I'll assume little beyond that.",

        "description": "Facebook's React has changed the way we think about web applications and user interface development. Due to its design, you can use it beyond web. A feature known as the Virtual DOM enables this.In this chapter we'll go through some of the basic ideas behind the library so you understand React a little better before moving on.What is React?React is a JavaScript library that forces you to think in terms of components. This model of thinking fits user interfaces well. Depending on your background it might feel alien at first. You will have to think very carefully about the concept of state and where it belongs.Because state management is a difficult problem, a variety of solutions have appeared. In this book, we'll start by managing state ourselves and then push it to a Flux implementation known as Alt. There are also implementations available for several other alternatives, such as Redux, MobX, and Cerebral.React is pragmatic in the sense that it contains a set of escape hatches. If the React model doesn't work for you, it is still possible to revert back to something lower level. For instance, there are hooks that can be used to wrap older logic that relies on the DOM. This breaks the abstraction and ties your code to a specific environment, but sometimes that's the pragmatic thing to do.One of the fundamental problems of programming is how to deal with state. Suppose you are developing a user interface and want to show the same data in multiple places. How do you make sure the data is consistent?Historically we have mixed the concerns of the DOM and state and tried to manage it there. React solves this problem in a different way. It introduced the concept of the Virtual DOM to the masses.Virtual DOM exists on top of the actual DOM, or some other render target. It solves the state manipulation problem in its own way. Whenever changes are made to it, it figures out the best way to batch the changes to the underlying DOM structure. It is able to propagate changes across its virtual tree as in the image above.Virtual DOM PerformanceHandling the DOM manipulation this way can lead to increased performance. Manipulating the DOM by hand tends to be inefficient and is hard to optimize. By leaving the problem of DOM manipulation to a good implementation, you can save a lot of time and effort.React allows you to tune performance further by implementing hooks to adjust the way the virtual tree is updated. Though this is often an optional step.The biggest cost of Virtual DOM is that the implementation makes React quite big. You can expect the bundle sizes of small applications to be around 150-200 kB minified, React included. gzipping will help, but it's still big.",

With a little JavaScript experience under your belt, you'll be up and running in no time creating dynamic web applications. Craft isolated components that make your apps easier to develop and maintain, with plenty of guidance on best practices. Set up automated tests, and make pages render fast for your users. See how to use your React skills to integrate with other front-end technologies when needed. Dive right into React by defining components, the basic building blocks of a React application. Integrate modern JavaScript language features such as classes and arrow functions in your app. Analyze the relationships in your data to isolate state, and sync the data model with what your users see. Once you're familiar with how a React application works, organize your code base with modules. Configure a production build and deliver your app as efficiently as possible with Webpack. Master testing with React-specific advice and tools to catch the most bugs with the least amount of code. Learn the basics of the Redux library. Define actions and manage an immutable central state with reducers, then connect Redux to your React components to build even larger and more complex interfaces. Package your React code as a standalone widget so anyone can use it in their own applications. Reuse existing JavaScript code in your React components, and build a new React view on top of an existing data model shared with a legacy application. When you finish this book, you'll be well on your way to solving your front-end problems with React. What You Need: Node.js 6.x or later, and a modern web browser.",

        "description": "Stéphane Hessel, recently published a short pamphlet titled “Get Angry” (Indignez-vous). In it, Hessel asserts that today’s youth should assume the same indignation that his generation in its turn had against Nazism and capitalism, as well as indignation against financial capital inequality what Israel does in Palestine (it is worth remembering that Hessel is Jewish) and the indifference that has gripped the world in the face of the injustices and inefficiencies of the current financial economic system. It is a beautiful text, less than 30 pages long, and has been largely successful. I bought the 13th edition in French in Hamburg. Next to a bookshop in a café Balzac, I read the entire text and, inspired by Hessel, who I would meet some months after, wrote this “React”.",

        "description": "Assemble the complete stack required to build a modern web app using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node. This book also covers many other complementary tools: React Router, GraphQL, React-Bootstrap, Babel, and Webpack. This new edition will use the latest version of React (React 16) and the latest React Router (React Router 4), which has a significantly different approach to routing compared to React Router 2 which was used in the first edition of the book. Though the primary focus of Pro MERN Stack is to equip you with all that is required to build a full-fledged web application, a large portion of the book will be devoted to React 16. The popular MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node) stack introduced Single Page Apps (SPAs) and front-end Model-View-Controller (MVC) as new and efficient paradigms. Facebook's React is a technology that competes indirectly with AngularJS. It is not a full-fledged MVC framework. It is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (in some sense the View part). Yet, it is possible to build a web app by replacing AngularJS with React – hence the term MERN stack What You Will Learn Discover the features of React 16 to get the maximum out of this library Gain the basics of MongoDB, Express, and Node to build a web app Work with other libraries complementary to React, including React-Bootstrap, React Router, and GraphQL Use tools such as Babel and Webpack required to build JavaScript-based SPAs Tie all the components together to build a complete web app. Who This Book Is For Developers and architects who have prior experience in any web app stack other than the MERN stack will find the book useful to learn about this modern stack. Prior knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS is required.",
