Or perhaps you're interested assessing the changes before moving over? If so, then Switching to Angular 2 is the book for you. To get the most out of the book, you'll need to be familiar with AngularJS 1.x, and have a good understanding of JavaScript. No knowledge of the changes made to Angular 2 is required follow along. What You Will Learn Understand the changes made from Angular 1.x with side-by-side code samples to help demystify the Angular 2 learning curve Start working with Angular 2's new method of implementing directives Use TypeScript to write modern, powerful Angular 2 applications Dig in to the change-detection method, and other architectural changes to make sure you know what's going on under the hood of Angular 2. Get to work with the new router in Angular 2 Use the new features of Angular 2 including pipes, or the updated features such as forms, services, and the DI module Master server-side rendering in Angular 2 to keep your new applications SEO friendly In Detail AngularJS is a JavaScript framework that makes building web applications easier. It is used today in large-scale, high-traffic websites that struggle with under-performance, portability issues, as well as SEO unfriendliness, and complexity at scale. Angular 2 changes that. It is the modern framework you need to build performant and robust web applications. “Switching to Angular 2” is the quickest way to get to grips with Angular 2 and will help you transition in to the brave new world of Angular 2. We'll start with an overview which sets the changes of the framework in context with version 1.x. After that, you will be taken on a TypeScript crash-course so we can take advantage of Angular 2 in its native, statically-typed environment. We'll look at the new change-detection method in detail, how Directives and Components change how you create websites with Angular, the new Angular 2 router, and much more. By the end of the book, you'll be ready to start building quick and efficient Angular 2 applications that take advantage of all the new features on offer. Style and approach Starting with a comparison between Angular versions that is filled with side-by-side code examples to help highlight the changes, each chapter then looks at major changes to the framework as is filled with small examples and sample code to get you started",

Beginning with the quantization of angular momentum, spin angular momentum, and the orbital angular momentum, the author goes on to discuss the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for a two-component system. After developing the necessary mathematics, specifically spherical tensors and tensor operators, the author then investigates the 3-j, 6-j, and 9-j symbols. Throughout, the author provides practical applications to atomic, molecular, and nuclear physics. These include partial-wave expansions, the emission and absorption of particles, the proton and electron quadrupole moment, matrix element calculation in practice, and the properties of the symmetrical top molecule.",

        "description": "This book is concerned with the practical aspects of solving angular momentum problems. The novel but fully tested-out method (the Invariant Graph Method) allows one to write down from a single graph the complete final result of the problem. The drawing of the graph involves very few simple, essentially self-evident rules. Still it is a powerful tool to easily solve the most involved physical problems.The method is introduced step-by-step in a sequence of examples, beginning with the simplest matrix elements, and ending with the most general case of a reaction including angular distributions and correlations. The many-body and particle anti-particle systems are fully developed. All aspects: wave functions, vectors, operators, Fock space state vectors and operators, etc., are treated on the same footing. All concepts of angular momentum theory acquire a transparent meaning. Hence the book is valuable not only as a handbook in problem solving, but extremely so as an adjunct in any course on advanced qunatum physics, atomic, molecular, nuclear and particle physics.",

        "description": "Young stars are surrounded by massive, rotating disks of dust and gas, which supply a reservoir of material that may be incorporated into planets or accreted onto the central star. In this dissertation, I use high angular resolution observations at a range of wavelengths to understand the structure, ubiquity, and evolutionary timescales of protoplanetary disks. First, I describe a study of Class I protostars, objects believed to be at an evolutionary stage between collapsing spherical clouds and fully-assembled young stars surrounded by protoplanetary disks. I use a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code to model new 0.9 micron scattered light images, 1.3 mm continuum images, and broadband spectral energy distributions. This modeling shows that Class I sources are probably surrounded by massive protoplanetary disks embedded in massive infalling envelopes. For the best-fitting models of the circumstellar dust distributions, I determine several important properties, including envelope and disk masses, mass infall rates, and system inclinations, and I use these results to constrain the evolutionary stage of these objects. Second, I discuss observations of the innermost regions of more evolved disks around T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be stars, obtained with the Palomar Testbed and Keck Interferometers. I constrain the spatial and temperature structure of the circumstellar material at sub-AU radii, and demonstrate that lower-mass stars are surrounded by inclined disks with puffed-up inner edges 0.1-1 AU from the star. In contrast, the truncated inner disks around more massive stars may not puff-up, indicating that disk structure depends on stellar properties. I discuss the implications of these results for disk accretion, terrestrial planet formation and giant planet migration. Finally, I put these detailed studies of disk structure into a broader context by constraining the mass distribution and evolutionary timescales of circumstellar disks. Using the Owens Valley Millimeter Array, I mapped the millimeter continuum emission toward >300 low-mass stars in the NGC 2024 and Orion Nebula clusters. These observations demonstrate that the average disk mass in each cluster is comparable to the \"minimum-mass protosolar nebula,\" and that there may be disk evolution on one million year timescales.",
